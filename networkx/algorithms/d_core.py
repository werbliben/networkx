Find the d-cores of a graph.

The d-core is found by recursively pruning nodes with degrees less than k.

Generalized Cores

https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0202039

For directed graphs a more general notion is that of D-cores which
looks at (k, l) restrictions on (in, out) degree. The (k, k) D-core
is the k-core.

    A k-core is a maximal subgraph that contains nodes of degree k or more.

    The core number of a node is the largest value k of a k-core containing
    that node.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph or directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    d_core_number : dictionary
       A dictionary keyed by node to the core number.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The d-core is not implemented for graphs with self loops
        or parallel edges or undirected graphs.

    Notes
    -----
    Not implemented for graphs with parallel edges or self loops.

    Only node out-degree is considered. For k-cores use core_number(G) node degree is defined to be the
    in-degree + out-degree.
